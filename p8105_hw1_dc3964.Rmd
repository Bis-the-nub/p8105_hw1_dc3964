```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 

```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
summary(early_january_weather)
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```
The `early_january_weather` dataset contains variables include `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `origin` (Newark airport), `temp` (temperature in Fahrenheit), `dewp` (dew point), `humid` (relative humidity), `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip` (precipitation in inches), `pressure` (sea level pressure in millibars), `visib` (visibility in miles), and `time_hour` (yyyy/mm/dd/hr/min/second). 

This dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. The mean temperature during this period is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE)` degrees Fahrenheit.

## Problem 2
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(123)  # reproducibility

# build tibble
tb <- tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  positive = sample > 0,
  chr_10 = c("This","class","is","important",
            "for","my","future","studying","in","biostatistics"),
  factor_level = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), length.out = 10))
)

# attempting to calculate average
tb %>% pull(sample) %>% mean()
tb %>% pull(positive) %>% mean()
tb %>% pull(chr_10) %>% mean()
tb %>% pull(factor_level) %>% mean()
```
Only the first two variables 'sample' and 'positive' works, the latter two variables returned NA value.
```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}
# apply as.numeric() to logical, character, and factor variables
as.numeric(tb$sample)
as.numeric(tb$positive)
as.numeric(tb$chr_10)
as.numeric(tb$factor_level)
```
When as.numeric() is applied, logical values are converted to 1 and 0, so taking the mean works and gives the proportion of TRUE values, this can also be applied when using mean(). Character vectors cannot be converted to numbers, so as.numeric() returns NA and produces a warning, which is why mean() fails.   
Factor vectors are converted to their internal integer when using as.numeric(), allowing R to calculate its mean (although it is meaningless). However, when computing directly with mean(), it will return as NA since mean() will not convert the factor vectors.
