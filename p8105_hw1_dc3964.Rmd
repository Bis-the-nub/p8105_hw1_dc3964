```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 

```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
summary(early_january_weather)
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```
The `early_january_weather` dataset contains variables include `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `origin` (Newark airport), `temp` (temperature in Fahrenheit), `dewp` (dew point), `humid` (relative humidity), `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip` (precipitation in inches), `pressure` (sea level pressure in millibars), `visib` (visibility in miles), and `time_hour` (yyyy/mm/dd/hr/min/second). 

This dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. The mean temperature during this period is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE)` degrees Fahrenheit.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
